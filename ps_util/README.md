## util

### Requirements:
- `pycparser`
- `autopxd`
- `pystache`

### Notes
These are development tools in various states of functionality. Probably most
interesting is the `gen_pxd.py`. You can add headers to the
`polysync/include/polysync_apis.h` in order to genereate a pxd interface file.
It was used to generate the `polysync/__init__.pxd` in full.
